### Some Will Depart from the Faith

```
4 Now the Spirit expressly says
    that in later times
        some will depart from the faith
            by devoting themselves
                to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,
        2 through the insincerity of liars
            whose consciences are seared,
            3 who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods
                that God created to be received with thanksgiving
                    by those who believe and know the truth.
                        4 For everything created by God is good,
                            and nothing is to be rejected
                                if it is received with thanksgiving,
                                5 for it is made holy
                                    by the word of God and prayer.

### A Good Servant of Christ Jesus

```
6 If you put these things before the brothers,
    you will be a good servant
        of Christ Jesus,
    being trained
        in the words of the faith
        and of the good doctrine
            that you have followed.
    7 Have nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths.
        Rather train yourself for godliness;
            8 for while bodily training is of some value,
            godliness is of value in every way,
                as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.
                    9 The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance.
                        10 For to this end we toil and strive,
                            because we have our hope set on the living God,
                                who is the Savior of all people,
                                    especially of those who believe.
