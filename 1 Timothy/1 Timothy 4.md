### Some Will Depart from the Faith

```
4 Now the Spirit expressly says
    that in later times
        some will depart from the faith
            by devoting themselves
                to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,
        2 through the insincerity of liars
            whose consciences are seared,
            3 who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods
                that God created to be received with thanksgiving
                    by those who believe and know the truth.
                        4 For everything created by God is good,
                            and nothing is to be rejected
                                if it is received with thanksgiving,
                                5 for it is made holy
                                    by the word of God and prayer.
