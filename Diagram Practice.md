# Diagraming Practice

## Outling

Main points always come from the indentation. There should always be a direct tie to the diagram. 

## 1 John 2:15-17

```
15a Do not love the world                                   main statement
15b nor (love) the things in the world.                     alternative 15a
15c     If anyone loves the world,                          conditional 15d
15d the love of the Father is not in him.                   parallel 15ab
16a     For all…is not from the Father,                     causal  15d
16b         that is in the world, the lust of the flesh     noun/relative (all)
            and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life…
16c     but is from the world.                              contrast 16a
17a     And the world is passing away, ​​​​​​​​                     parallel 16a
17b     and also its lusts (are passing away);              parallel 17a
17c     but the one… lives forever.                         contrast 17b
17d         who does the will of God….                      relative 17c

### Outline

#### OPTION 3

2 Eternally Significant Contrasts that explain why the love of the world must be rejected:
1. A Contrast of Sources - v.16
    1. That which we are naturally drawn to is from the world - v.16bc
    1. That which we are spiritually drawn to is from the Father - v.16a
2. A Contrast of Ends - v.17
    1. Those who evidently love the world are perishing - v.17ab
    1. Those who evidently have the love of the Father live forever - v.17cd

#### Option 2

Two warnings about loving the world. 

1. We must not love the world - v.15ab
1. The truth about loving the world - v.15d 
    1. Same as option 1? - v.16
    1. Same as option 1? - v.17

#### Option 1

Two reasons belivers must gaurd against loving the world or the things of the world

1. Because the things of this world have no spiritual life - v.16
1. Because the things of this world are temporary (have no eternal value) - v.17
