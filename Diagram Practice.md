# Diagraming Practice

## Outlining

Main points always come from the indentation. There should always be a direct tie to the diagram. A means to draw out the points can be to use the first point at each level of indentation (avoid supportive clauses).

Remember the outline is a tool for the teacher and although it must be grammatically correct there are multiple ways to get there.

## Philippians 2:14-18

```txt
14a Do all things without grumbling                                   main statement
14b or (do all things without) disputing;                             parallel 14a
15a   so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, purpose 14ab
      children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and
      perverse generation, 
15b     among whom you appear as lights in the world,                 relative 15a
16a     (by) holding fast the word of life,                           means 15a 
16b       so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory    purpose 16a
16c         because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain.           cause 16b
17a         But…I rejoice                                             contrast 16c
17b         and share my joy with you all.                            parallel 17a
17b           …even if I am being poured out as a drink               concession 17ab
              offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith…
18a         You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way              parallel 17a
18b         and (I urge you to) share your joy with me.               parallel 18a
```

### Outline

2 reasons we must avoid sinful speach:

1. Because we are to remain as light among onlookers - v.15-16
1. Because we are to rejoice and share our joy with one another - v.17-18

## 1 John 2:15-17

```txt
15a Do not love the world                                               main statement
15b nor (love) the things in the world.                                 alternative 15a
15c     If anyone loves the world,                                      conditional 15d
15d the love of the Father is not in him.                               parallel 15ab
16a     *For* all…is not from the Father,                               causal  15d
16b         that is in the world, the lust of the flesh                 noun/relative (all)
            and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life…
16c     __**but**__ is from the world.                                  contrast 16a
17a     And (*for*) the world is passing away, ​​​​​​​​                         parallel 16a
17b     and also its lusts (are passing away);                          parallel 17a
17c     __**but**__ the one… lives forever.                             contrast 17b
17d         who does the will of God….                                  relative 17c

### Outline

#### Option 3

2 Eternally Significant Contrasts that explain why the love of the world must be rejected:

1. A Contrast of Sources - v.16
    1. The Father does not fuel self-infatuation - v.16bc
    1. The world feeds/incites self-infatuation - v.16a
1. A Contrast of Ends - v.17
    1. The transience of worldliness - v.17ab
    1. The eternality of godliness - v.17cd

#### Option 2

Two warnings about loving the world. 

1. We must not love the world - v.15ab
1. The truth about loving the world - v.15d 
    1. Same as option 1? - v.16
    1. Same as option 1? - v.17

#### Option 1

Two reasons believers must guard against loving the world or the things of the world - v.15

1. Because the things of this world have no spiritual life - v.16
1. Because the things of this world are temporary (have no eternal value) - v.17
