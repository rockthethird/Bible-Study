15b nor (love) the things in the world.
15c If anyone loves the world,

16b that is in the world, the lust of the flesh
and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life…
16c but is from the world.
17a And the world is passing away, ​​​​​​​​
17b and also its lusts (are passing away);
17c but the one… lives forever.
17d who does the will of God….                               Rel 17c
