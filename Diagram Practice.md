# Diagraming Practice

## Outlining

Main points always come from the indentation. However, pay more attention to the labels and do not overthink the indentation. There should always be a direct tie to the diagram. A means to draw out the points can be to use the first point at each level of indentation (avoid supportive clauses).

Remember the outline is a tool for the teacher and although it must be grammatically correct there are multiple ways to get there.

### Outline

#### Option 1

3 reasons to remain confident when sharing God's truth

### Outline

#### Option 3

2 Eternally Significant Contrasts that explain why the love of the world must be rejected:

1. A Contrast of Sources - v.16

    1. The eternality of godliness - v.17cd

#### Option 2

Two warnings about loving the world.

1. We must not love the world - v.15ab
1. The truth about loving the world - v.15d
    1. Same as option 1? - v.16
    1. Same as option 1? - v.17

#### Option 1

Two reasons believers must guard against loving the world or the things of the world - v.15

1. Because the things of this world have no spiritual life - v.16
1. Because the things of this world are temporary (have no eternal value) - v.17
