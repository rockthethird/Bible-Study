# Diagraming Practice

## Outlining

Main points always come from the indentation. However, pay more attention to the labels and do not overthink the indentation. There should always be a direct tie to the diagram. A means to draw out the points can be to use the first point at each level of indentation (avoid supportive clauses).

Remember the outline is a tool for the teacher and although it must be grammatically correct there are multiple ways to get there.

## Ephesians 5:25-33

25a Husbands, love your wives,                                                              main statement

28b     as their own bodies.                                                                comparison 28a

30a                     because we are members of His body.                                 causal 29d

#### Option 1

Two ways a husband must love his wife as Christ loved the church

1. By caring for her in the manner he cares for himself

1. Because we are to rejoice and share our joy with one another - v.17-18

### Outline

#### Option 3

2 Eternally Significant Contrasts that explain why the love of the world must be rejected:

1. A Contrast of Sources - v.16
    1. The Father does not fuel self-infatuation - v.16bc
    1. The world feeds/incites self-infatuation - v.16a
1. A Contrast of Ends - v.17
    1. The transience of worldliness - v.17ab
    1. The eternality of godliness - v.17cd

#### Option 2

Two warnings about loving the world.

1. We must not love the world - v.15ab
1. The truth about loving the world - v.15d
    1. Same as option 1? - v.16
    1. Same as option 1? - v.17

#### Option 1

Two reasons believers must guard against loving the world or the things of the world - v.15

1. Because the things of this world have no spiritual life - v.16
1. Because the things of this world are temporary (have no eternal value) - v.17
