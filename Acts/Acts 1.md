# Acts 1

## “What God’s People Must do to be Prepared for Ministry-Pt.1”

_In Acts 1:4-26, there are 3 essential elements that prepare us for ministry:_

(May 12, 2024)

1. Wait for what the Lord has Promised—vv.4-5

    - Waiting is not passive, we must wait on/in His word, which is waiting/hoping on His promises and what He provides

    - Nothing spiritual happens without the Holy Spirit so we are waiting on His timing is important

1. Trust in what the Lord has Planned—vv.6-11

    - This is the kingdom to come that will have global reign, unlike what has been up to now (regional kingdoms)
    - They were right about the kingdom to come but their desire to knowing the timing was rebuked
    - "times or seasons" demonstrates that it will not be immediate, and more so, that we are not to concern ourselves about His timing but instead to our obedience to His will
    - Be faithful without knowing the outcome of our prayers and desires for those we are burdened for

    - His return will be obvious and visible

3. Depend on what the Lord has Prepared—vv.12-26

    (May 19, 2024)

    i. By Seeking Him in Unified Prayer—vv.12-14

    - Journey was less than what is allowed on the Sabbath
    - Unified in the inward
    - Removal of self/die to self to remain unified on what Christ has done
    - We must seek what god has promised, by being devoted in prayer

    ii. By Processing Events through the Scriptures—vv.15-20

    - Brethren demonstrates a new humble posture for Peter, in contrast to his previous proclamations
    - They turned to the scriptures for their direction as their prayers were answered to know what scripture had been fulfilled
    - So should we during our trials

    iii. By Trusting in His Absolute Omniscience—vv.21-26

    - The meaning of 12 has eternal foundations of judgement like what is found in Revelations
    - This is an example of how we don't need to know the heart in order to more forward with someone, God will reveal in His timing
    - They did not have the Holy Spirit when casting lots and reverted back to Old Testament ways
    - Acts, as a narrative, is not prescriptive like the epistles, therefore a move away from this practice shows the Holy Spirit become the trustworthy source of making decisions
