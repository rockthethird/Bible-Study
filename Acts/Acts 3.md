# Acts 3

## “How the Church Promoted the Preeminence of Christ - Pt. 1”

(July 28, 2024)

_In Acts 3:1-4:31, there are 3 commitments to the preeminence of Christ that ensure Christ is not replaced in our approach to the Christian life:_

1. Exalting Christ’s Supreme Power - 3:1-12

    - This man was clearly known by these in the temple
    - All of those signs were to point at the Lord's work
    - Peter quickly corrected the people who had began to worship them (the apostles)

1. Recognizing Christ’s Promised Redemption - 3:13-26

    - Once again they wre charged with killing of Christ
    - Faith in jesus and later "that is through Jesus" points to the preeminence of Christ's power
    - The cross is the stumbling block for the Jews who the messiah would be, but Peter is reassuring them this was God's plan
    - Unbelief is what prevents us from knowing Jesus as the fulfillment of the Old Testament

3. Magnifying Christ’s Exclusive Name - 4:1-31

(August 18, 2024)

_2 characteristics of the apostles’ ministry amidst adversity that all Christians must mimic in order to magnify Christ’s exclusive name:_

1. While being threatened, they declared salvation is found
only in Christ - vv.1-12

    1. Tribulation is ordained by God to build the church - vv.1-4

        - Adversity demonstrates the glory of and preeminence of Christ in a way that prosperity never can
        - Sadducees believe only in pentateuch (first 5 books) and selected what doctrines to believe
        - True repentance must be costly

    1. Tribulation is ordained by God to provide witnessing opportunities - vv.5-12

        - There was no questioning of the miracles only disbelief that anything supernatural did not come through them (the jewish nation)
