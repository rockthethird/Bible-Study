# Acts 5

## “The Church Grows Through Refining in Purity”

(September 8, 2024 - started Acts 4)

2. A Church Grows by Fearing the Consequences of Sin—vv.1-11

    - Ananias and Sapphira were not doing this to please God
    - What happened shows they wanted the same recognition others were given for their sacrifice to benefit the church
    - The giving was spontaneous and not commanded, further supporting the idea of their pridefulness
    - This act shows God's commitment to His holiness and the (true) church cannot be impure
    - Very likely unbelievers in that they put God the the test and having been influenced by satan like in Ephesians 2
    - We should fear when we see God directly deals with sin and how much He hates sin, especially since sin embodies natural state of man
