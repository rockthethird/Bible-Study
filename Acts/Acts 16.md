### A believer's Joy: Living Wholly Devoted to Christ

_2 Elements of devotion to Christ that produce enduring joy:_

1. A Recognition of the Lord's Sovereign Working, Even in Difficult Circumstances

    - Do I rejoice in all circumstances?

    - Am I joyful?

    - Supernaturally produced, and yet commanded

    - All we do must be to this same ends as Paul demonstrates
    
    - The Word of God cannot be bound

    - Paul's disposition encouraged other to be bold

    - His imprisonment was the means/"tool" the Lord used to encourage the other believers

1. A Pursuit of Christ's Exclusive Honor, Even at the Expense of Self

    - The motives in which a true Gospel is proclaimed does not reduce its effectiveness

    - Joy comes from while heartily devoting <u>all</u> to Christ and His honor and purpose!

    - Devotion at this level demonstrates the depth to which we believe in the truth of our God and all that he has promised and revealed
