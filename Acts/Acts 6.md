### “The Growth of the Church Through a Christlike Martyr—Pt.1”

(October 6, 2024)

_To avoid becoming dismayed at God’s purposes, we must learn from 3 examples of how God orchestrates circumstances to use his faithful servants to spread the gospel:_

1. God uses the mistreatment of his faithful servants to spread the gospel—6:8-15

    - Grace here is divine enablement

    - Men that rise up are opposing the Spirit, not Stephen

    - Self-righteous thinking leads to the blinding of the truth; how else would they ignore what they saw or Stephen's face, so far as to perhaps assume demonic forces

1. God uses the proclamation of his faithful servants to spread the gospel—7:1-53

    1. Your covenant with God is based on his grace—vv.1-8

        - Saying "fathers" he was kinking all of his shared jewish heritage and all christians, even gentiles

        - If we believe these truths how would we loo toward external works or circumstances for our standing before God
