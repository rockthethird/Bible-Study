# Acts 4

## “How the Church Promoted the Preeminence of Christ - Pt. 5”

### 3. Magnifying Christ’s Exclusive Name - 4:1-31

(August 25, 2024)

_2 characteristics of the apostles’ ministry amidst adversity that all Christians must mimic in order to magnify Christ’s exclusive name:_

- Boldness is directly from the reliance on God's power/message (testimony of the gospel)
- William Tyndale as a great example of boldness

2. While being threatened, they maintained boldness in their commitment to Christ - v.13-31

    1. The effect on the antagonists - vv.13-22

        - We may disobey government authority only if they contradicts biblical teaching

    1. The effect on the church - vv.23-31

        - When under trial we should come to God in recognition of who He is, knowing He has ordained all things and they will glorify His name
        - Nothing can extinguish God's work
        - The spirit came upon them for their unique ministry
        - Any hostility is against Christ because they hate the light in which an obedient christian is displaying
        - We are always spiritually safe even if not temporarily safe in the flesh

## “The Church Grows through Fellowship in Unity”

(September 1, 2024)

_2 characteristics of the early church that all Christians must possess to fellowship in the unity of Christ’s saving work:_

1. Genuine oneness that eradicates possessiveness—v.32

1. Powerful grace that eliminates neediness—vv.33-35

    - Key is the root "need" as equality is not what is demonstrated
    - Distribution through the apostles was a means of increasing the discernment of how to best help someone who has unmeet needs, who may have increased clarity in how someone is disqualified of receiving help
    - The main focus of needs is directed at the body

## “The Church Grows Through Refining in Purity”

(September 8, 2024)

_In Acts 4:36-5:11, there are 2 ways the Lord grew the early church in holiness that should have a sanctifying effect on all Christians:_

1. A Church Grows by Following Faithful Examples—vv.36-37

    - As a levite Joseph (Barnabas) should not have owned land according to the law which he should have been an ambassador, yet he was a hypocrite
    - The levites were an example of living a life in full trust in the Lords provision
