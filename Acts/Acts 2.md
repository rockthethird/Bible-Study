(June 23, 2024)

_In vv.25-36, there are 2 features of Christ’s redemptive work that make him worthy of lordship:_

- Lord is a divine definition
- Lordship is evidenced by our life's actions, not our words or mental exercises

        - We must place Christ as Lord or we do not have Him as savior

#### 4. The Spirit’s Work is Powerfully Effective - vv.37-47

(June 30, 2024)

_In vv.37-47, there are 3 ways the Spirit’s work is demonstrated to be powerfully effective, which will provide us with an excellent assessment of the Spirit’s activity in our lives:_

1. Spirit Produced Conviction-v.37

    - Guilt is a necessary prelude to conviction
    - Conviction is evidence the Spirit is at work
    - Conviction is not the end, it is a means to Christ-likeness
    - Conviction does not transform in and of itself
    - v.36 "no where to turn" is more evidence of the Sprit's work

2. Spirit Produced Repentance - vv.38-41

    - Repentance is a turning from sin into a new path
        1. Sight of sin
        1. Owning the sin
        1. Sorrow/Shame/Guilt of sin
        1. Hatred of sin
        1. Confessing the sin
        1. Turning from sin
    - Repent, believe, faith are so inseparable that they can be used interchangeably, thought they are not synonymous
    - Repentance here v.38, is expressed in the baptism in the name of Jesus, they just hated 50 days ago
    - Faith is an entrustment to Jesus
    Repentance is not spurred up with man, does not originate in man, yet God enables man to believe, otherwise we could take credit for our salvation
