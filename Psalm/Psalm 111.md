## Sermon Notes

Pastor Phillip Sanders (January 14, 2024)

### A Life of Praise

_2 essential elements of a life of praise:_

1. Diligently studying the works of God - vv.2-9

    - Worship is not an activity, it is to be our entire life

    - Nothing God does is ordinary, greatness is all encompassing His works

    - The intake of the word fuels worship of God's works

    - Study of the word increases our worship

    - God's righteousness makes His works more glorious

    - A diligent study of God's word gives assurance of the trustworthiness of God's word

1. Obediently living according to the wisdom of God - v.10

    - Wise living and worship are one in the same

    - Appreciation (alone) and application are not equal

    - Appreciation should lead to application of truth

    - Fear = a reverent respect

    - Those who fear God keep and delight in His commandments and will seek to have a mind like God

    - Let us be a part of this praise
