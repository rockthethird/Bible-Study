### Give Thanks for God Grace vv. 10-16

_2 Truths the Fuel Thanksgiving to God_

Introduction:

- Being thankful is response to gracious work of God's salvation

- Giving thanks is a command; don't wait for feelings

1. The hopeless miser of your sin vv.10-12

    - Describes the reality of distress, misery, and suffering

    - The imagery of much suffering that is so great that only death would bring relief

        - Misery so great that it brings one just short of death

    - Sin is bad because God is so great or holy

    - Describes our condition apart from Christ

    - Pride stops the current/flow of thanksgiving

1. The immense mercy of your sin vv.13-16

    - Being humbled with a burden from God is a mercy, giving then the ability to see one's need for Him vv.12->13

    - Bringing someone out of darkness (a complete reversal) is the completion of His mercy

    - The bondage of sin is broken by our salvation
