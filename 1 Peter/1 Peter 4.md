 # 1 Peter 4

 ## Sermon Notes

 ### 1 PETER 4:7-11 “A Church Ready for Christ”

_4 appropriate responses of Christians based on the nearness of Christ’s return:_

#### I. Being sensibly alert to seek God’s help - v.7

#### II. Being deeply committed to loving each other - v.8

- Agape love

- Other's sin must not disqualify them from our love

- Love covering a multiple of sins does not prevent the loving act of bring someone's sins to their attention

- Not addressing sin is an act of fear of the consequences that may come

#### III. Being warmly inviting towards one another - v.9

- "One another" restricts this command to the church body

- The hospitality requires sacrifice

- Must not expect recognition for the sacrifice of serving

#### IV. Being actively responsible with what God has given - vv.10-11

- Serving the body helps bring to light our gifts

- We are stewards of the gifts and therefore they can be taken away

- "Oracles of God" simply means God's word which have already been said

- God's glory is on display when we have had to sacrifice something to ensure it's not our strength
