### Craving the Word for Spiritual Growth vv.1-3

_3 instructions about craving the Word that promotes spiritual growth:_

1. Remove all sinful hindrances: the prerequisite of our craving - v.1

    - Our craving MUST be as strong as a newborn whose only concern is have their needs meet

    - You cannot long for the Word if you have not put aside/destroy the practice of sin

    - These particular sis are all opposed to others, the entire law can be summarized

1. Pursue the proper nourishment: the object of our craving - v.2

    - In loving your neighbor and therefore all sin must be removed

    - Pure = complete, unadulterated

    - Do not consume only versus which make you happy or that which has been altered for easier listening

1. Review God's goodness: the incentive for our craving - v.3

    - This is a rhetorical question starting with "if" where in the original greek where the positive answer is assumed

    - Works as a reminder to provide an incentive
