### Hope-Filled Praise

_3 truths about hope that propel our praise:_

1. We must Praise God because our hope comes from God's undeserved work

    - Assuredly will happen

    - Peter is reminding them to look past the circumstances of persecution v.1

    - The reborn analogy in and of itself demonstrates that we can have nothing to do with it!

1. We must praise God because our hope anticipates God's glorious provision

    - The inheritance is so glorious that we <u>must</u> see it with the negative characteristics to know it full, a great contrast to earthly experience

    - That which causes this world and its good to gain an ew (reduced) luster

1. We must praise God because our Hope is secured by God's powerful protection

    - We are nothing more than a vessel through which God's power and purpose is being displayed
