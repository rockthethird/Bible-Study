### A Window into a Pastor's Heart

_Three displays of a faithful pastor_

1. God focused and dependent

    - Ultimately only need to please Christ

    - Fully dependent on God's power to boldly proclaim the gospel in moments where we are tested

    - Lack of prayer shows ignorance/prideful living

1. Elders are to pursue godly character and humility

    - Following Jesus is unlearning to follow self

    - What you say is what you should be willing to live

    - __Pray for humility in our leaders__

1. Pastors are burdened for people's salvation and sanctification

    - They are to be the living example to the church

    - __Pray for elders for the additional burdens they take on for God's glory
