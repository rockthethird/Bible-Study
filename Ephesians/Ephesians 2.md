## Sermon Notes

### The Church: God's Spiritual Build Project vv.19-22 (June 25, 2023)

_2 features of God's household that Christians must know to be faithful members of that household:_

1. God's Blueprints of His household - v.20

    1. The foundational structure - v.20a

        - Destroys the foundation of pragmatism, moralism, legalism, secularism, etc.

    1. The primary place - v.20b

        - Corner stone is Christ so anything out of alignment due to the wrong foundation would cause the structure to fail

1. God's intentions for His household - vv.21-22

    1. To grow into a holy structure for God - v.21

        - Spiritual growth is the key, opposed to growth in number

        - We all now have direct access to the Lord as He is dwelling in the body of Christ

    1. To be built up into a spiritual habitation for God - v.22

        - The church isn't about us, we are saved for His glory!

        - Even individual/private sin affects the whole body
