#### II. That God would preserve his people as He leaves them in the world vv.6-19 (September 24, 2023)

_In order to have solid certainty of our salvation, Christians must believe in 4 truths that display God's powerful saving work to guarantee the final redemption of his people:_

1. __Jesus safeguards through the revealing of God's character - vv.6-10__

1. __The Father safeguards through the power of His name -  vv.11-12__

1. __The Father safeguards through the possession of His people - vv.13-16__

    - The world likewise wants full conformity, and is often angered without it

    - There is some way God gets greater glory leaving us in teh world while being sinners/saved children

    - Following God's commands is how He keeps us from stumbling and being devoured by the schemes of the devil

1. __The Father safeguards through the sanctification of His saints - vv.17-19__

    - The Word is truth and there fore we must know and believe /entrust ourselves to the truth which will look drastically different from the world (sanctified; holy; set apart)

1. __The safeguards through the possession of His people (October 1, 2023)__
