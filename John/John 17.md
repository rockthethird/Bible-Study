    - Disciples: "Enduring allegiance", though one sins they always repent and pursue the truth, and tremble at God's Word

    - They were the only ones <u>kept</u> in th moments leading up to the cross

1. The Father safeguards through the power of his name—vv.11-12

1. The Father safeguards through the possession of His people - vv.13-16 (October 1, 2023)

    - The world likewise wants full conformity, and is often angered without it

    - There is some way God gets greater glory leaving us in teh world while being sinners/saved children

    - Following God's commands is how He keeps us from stumbling and being devoured by the schemes of the devil

1. The Father safeguards through the sanctification of His saints - vv.17-19
