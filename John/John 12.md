# John 12

## Sermon Notes

#### I. What is Necessary for Pure Worship vv.12-26 (March 5, 2023)

_2 axioms that will protect the purity of our worship_

1. Enthusiasm for Jesus must be propelled by all of God's truth - vv.12-19

    i. Because it's natural to get excited about having earthly power - vv.12-16

    ii. Because it's natural to get excited about escaping death vv.17-19

    - Those that get excited are not about worship is not about worship it' merely about what they may get that will satisfy the desire of the flesh

    - We have freedom from the fear of death

1. Seeking out Jesus must be informed by self-sacrificing commitment - vv.20-26

    - Chapter 12 is a transition to "the hour has come"

    - Hatred is a contrast to love required to follow Christ (love = obedience)

    - As we learn how to love Christ our hatred of this life will increase

    - In honoring us Jesus in glorified all the more v.26b

#### II. What Christ Must Do To Rescue us From Darkness vv.27-50

_6 intentions of the cross that Christ must accomplish to bring us to the light:_

1. Christ Must Prioritize God's Glory - vv.27-30 (March 12, 2023)

1. Christ Must Defeat Evil Forces - v.31

1. Christ Must Call Sinners Effectually - v.32 (March 19, 2023)

    - Draw is very important to properly define and clearly observe the context of v.20

    - "All men" includes greeks/gentiles/non-jewish

    - Being acted upon by God we are enabled to be drawn or respond to God's drawing

1. Christ Must Give Sinners Light - vv.33-36

    - No one likes when Christ speaks of His death as they are only interested in tangible things His life is providing them (signs/temporal changes like healing)

    - Response to the light is essential; either walking in the light or fleeing to darkness because of their love for sin

    - The final public charge; walk in the light turns to belief; belief changes our status; one cannot be in the light and the darkness at the same time
