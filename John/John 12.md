## Sermon Notes

### What is Necessary for Pure Worship vv.12-26 (March 5, 2023)

_2 axioms that will protect the purity of our worship_

1. Enthusiasm for Jesus must be propelled by all of God's truth - vv.12-19

    1. Because it's natural to get excited about having earthly power - vv.12-16

    1. Because it's natural to get excited about escaping death vv.17-19

        - Those that get excited are not about worship is not about worship it' merely about what they may get that will satisfy the desire of the flesh

        - We have freedom from the fear of death

1. Seeking out Jesus must be informed by self-sacrificing commitment - vv.20-26

    - Chapter 12 is a transition to "the hour has come"

    - Hatred is a contrast to love required to follow Christ (love = obedience)

    - As we learn how to love Christ our hatred of this life will increase

    - In honoring us Jesus in glorified all the more v.26b

### What Christ Must Do To Rescue us From Darkness vv.27-36

_6 intentions of the cross that Christ must accomplish to bring us to the light:_

_Verify: why there are only 4 denoted below_

1. Christ Must Prioritize God's Glory - vv.27-30 (March 12, 2023)

    - Jesus also felt anguish and desire for the deliverance from physical torment

    - Our hope of salvation only comes because the Father did not rescue the Son

    - His anguish was magnified by His knowledge and need to take on all sin and its punishment

    - Without His renewing we are blind to God even with direct evidence

1. Christ Must Defeat Evil Forces - v.31

    - Christ's coming created a dividing line

    - Satin can be resisted by a believer

    - Because of the cross work our eyes can be opened to see that we were blinded by satan, and it provides the basis for resistance against him

1. Christ Must Call Sinners Effectually - v.32 (March 19, 2023)

    - Draw is very important to properly define and clearly observe the context of v.20

    - "All men" includes greeks/gentiles/non-jewish

    - Being acted upon by God we are enabled to be drawn or respond to God's drawing

1. Christ Must Give Sinners Light - vv.33-36

    - No one likes when Christ speaks of His death as they are only interested in tangible things His life is providing them (signs/temporal changes like healing)

    - Response to the light is essential; either walking in the light or fleeing to darkness because of their love for sin

    - The final public charge; walk in the light turns to belief; belief changes our status; one cannot be in the light and the darkness at the same time

### The Implications of Unbelief vv.37-50

_3 biblical precepts that provide tremendous hope that unbelief does not thwart God's redemptive plan_ (March 26, 2023)

1. Unbelief occurs despite a clear witness by God - vv.38-40

    - From a worldly perspective Jesus' mission, to this point, appears to be a complete failure

1. Unbelief earns a just judgment from God - vv.38-40

    - The natural state of man (sin) must be well understood as a foundation to understanding God not allowing someone to understand salvation

    - We all deserve judgment and God's grace is poured out on those He has predestined for the purpose of displaying His full glory (all attributes)

    - Blinding unbelievers is also a grace to minimize their judgement for rejecting the completed revelation of God, who is Jesus

1. Unbelief invokes a manifestation of the glory of God - v. 41

    - Judgement is too a requirement for displaying His glory

    - The jewish unbelief resulted in Christ's death which is God's salvific plan

_2 features of unbelief that should destroy any notion of self-trust_ (April 2, 2023)

1. Unbelief reveals idolatrous objects of trust in our hearts - vv.42-43

    - The praise of man over God reveals what one's life revolves around, what their thoughts, actions, and desires constantly work to satisfy

    - The idol cannot be satisfied, which is highlighted when Jesus says He is the living water that quenches

1. Unbelief keeps us from what only Christ can supply - vv.44-50

    1. Because it's only through faith in Christ that we are shown the Father - vv.44-45

    1. Because it's only through faith in Christ that we are delivered from the darkness - v.46

        - Important: One of the main indicators of saving faith

    1. Because it's only through faith in Christ that we are granted eternal life -- vv.47-50

        - The world is already judged
