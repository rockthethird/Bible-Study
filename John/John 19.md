### How Jesus Finished The Course (February 11, 2024)

_4 rock solid sureties of our faith in the finished work of Christ that ground our salvation in Him instead of in ourselves:_

1. Christ finished his work as an innocent king, not as a guilty criminal - vv.16-22

    - With crucifixion maximum shame is intended when made to bear the cross (horizontal beam) to place of punishment

    - Inscription of "King of the Jews" (in three languages) was a vengeful/spiteful action of Pilot as retaliation for being "forced" to crucify an innocent man

    - Christ declaring "when I am lifted up you will know that I am"

1. Christ finished his work to fulfill the Scriptures, not because he was powerless against man’s wickedness - vv.23-25

    - Most often quoted psalm

    - God has ordained every single part of this

1. Christ finished his work while caring for others, not thinking of himself - vv.25-27

    - "Disciple whom He loved" is safely known to be John

    - Even under such a burden, about to drink the cup of wrath, Christ shows us the importance of being mindful of those close to Him by giving the first joining of non-blood related into the family of Christ

1. Christ finished the work to fully accomplish redemption, not deviating in any way from the Father’s will - vv.28-30

    - Before taking His final breath He is fully aware of His victory

    - Scripture so beautifully fulfilled in physically need a drink to declare out "It is finished"

    - Even in His death He is in control
