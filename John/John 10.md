## Sermon Notes

### How God's Shepherd Differs From False Shepherds

#### I. God's Shepherd is the Way of Salvation vv.1-10 (November 27, 2022)

_2 Characteristics of God's Shepherd that Prove He is the Way of Salvation:_

1. He is Extensively Known - vv.1-6

    - Real shepard had a very dangerous job which required the ability to fight off thieves who would be violent in their means

    - Many of the shepard's sheep are of the same fold

    - Amongst many sheep from different folds, a sheep comes at the voice of its shepherd

    - The voice of Christ provides nourishment for our eternal soul

    - Note to self: study these warning in these verses focusing on the peddling/abusing of the Word of God

1. He Provides Extraordinary Safekeeping - vv. 7-10

    - Our efforts are ultimately not the means of our salvation

    - Abundant (no limits) life is eternally focused

    - God will always pursue His sheep (me)

    - Note to self: why would abundantly be in context of teh vapor that this earthly life is?
