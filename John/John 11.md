### Believing that Jesus is the Life Changes How We View Death

#### II. Since Christ is the Resurrection and the Life, we must believe that death is not an obstacle to His power - vv.17-35 (January 22, 2023)

_2 ways this belief is manifested:_

1. By affirming our confidence in the Lord - vv.17-28

    - Never forget He has power to do anything

    - Typical decay in this environment/setting is significant at four days

    - We live in Christ and have begun our eternal existence in this present time/circumstances

    - Our knowledge should bring confidence which should bring evidence that we live in faith

    - Our comfort is given so we should share

1. By taking our grief to the Lord vv.29-35

    - Mary's disposition was drastically different and required a different response from Jesus

    - "He was deeply moved" = He was holy agitated/angered

    - "troubled" = troubles Himself

    - Jesus wept = shed tears in the greek (weep with those who weep Romans 12:15)

    - God is so intimately involved with His creation
