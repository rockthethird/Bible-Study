## Sermon Notes

### Believing that Jesus is the Life Changes How We View Death

#### II. Since Christ is the Resurrection and the Life, we must believe that death is not an obstacle to His power vv.17-35 (January 22, 2023)

_2 ways this belief is manifested:_

1. By affirming our confidence in the Lord - vv.17-28

    - Never forget He has power to do anything

    - Typical decay in this environment/setting is significant at four days

    - We live in Christ and have begun our eternal existence in this present time/circumstances

    - Our knowledge should bring confidence which should bring evidence that we live in faith

    - Our comfort is given so we should share

1. By taking our grief to the Lord vv.29-35

    - Mary's disposition was drastically different and required a different response from Jesus

    - "He was deeply moved" = He was holy agitated/angered

    - "troubled" = troubles Himself

    - Jesus wept = shed tears in the greek (weep with those who weep Romans 12:15)

    - God is so intimately involved with His creation

#### Since Christ is the Resurrection and the Life, we must believe that death is not an obstacle to His redemption vv.45-54 (February 19, 2023)

_3 reasons that our faith must rest on the Lord's death_

1. Because a faith focused exclusively on the Lord's manifest power does not save - vv.45-46

    - Believing in God's power does not mean one trusts in the Lord for salvation of sin's consequence

1. Because it was God's intention for His Son to die in place of sinners - vv.47-53

    i. Which is in conjunction with the sinful intentions of man - vv.47-50

    - Sinful fear of the lose of an idol (power/wealth/etc.)

    - A high priests death would free those in the sanctuary city

    ii. Which supersedes the sinful intentions of man -- vv.51-53

    - Unparalleled example of prophesy

    - God is sovereign over it, man is responsible; both are true at the same time

### The various Motivations in Approaching Jesus - vv.11:55-12:11 (February 26, 2023)

_2 pair of responses that provide discernment about the heart when there is outward activity towards Christ:_

1. Sacrificial Love and Selfish Gain - vv.1-8

    - Mark takes liberty in time stamps to make his points

    - Mary gave up a significant earthly security to show her love toward Christ and using her hair was a deep commitment of humility

    - Recognize worth and respond in faithful obedience

    - It appears she is aware of His death

    - One heart gives so much, yet another betrays for so little

    - Disciples also agreed with it being "wasteful", although perhaps for different reasons

    - Only Christ centered activities are acceptable and come from a pure heart (charity for example)

1. Curious Wonderment and Murderous Feat - vv.9-11

    - Crowds do not automatically indicate God is working (Luke 9 shows this is correct)

    - Fear of losing cushy lifestyle if Romans came in to stamp out an uprising
