# John 18

## Sermon Notes

### How the Impotent Ways of Man are Confounded by the Sovereign Plan of God (December 17, 2023)

#### I. The purposes of Christ vs. the purposes of man vv.1-11

_Jesus’ responses expose 2 lies fueling those involved in his arrest:_

1. Lie #1—God’s plan can be conquered by human scheming - vv.1-9

2. Lie #2—God’s plan can be accomplished through human strength -  vv.10-11

    - Peter's prideful unbelief caused him to act (completely ignoring what Jesus just did with only 2 words) in a way that shows the need we have of God to provide the ability to know God's will

### Jesus Came to Bring the Truth v.37 (December 25, 2023)

_In order to take heed to the truth as we ought, there are 4 insights we must understand about Christ coming to testify to the truth:_

1. There is an absolute knowledge represented in this truth

    - All of what God is or does is truth because everything exists from God therefore nothing that is true can come from another source

1. Christ is the perfect representation of this truth

    - The Word became flesh

1. Eternal salvation can only be obtained through faith in this truth

    - We receive this truth as we are enabled to understand it and then we become witnesses of the truth

1. There will always be those who oppose this truth

    - Anyone who opposes the truth also opposes God

    - Their heart mut be changed by God if every they are to understand

#### II. The faithfulness of Christ vs. the compromise of man—vv.12-27

_2 ways that John highlights the faithfulness of Christ in contrast to the faithlessness of Peter that should propel our allegiance to Christ:_

1. Jesus’ compliance vs. Peter’s capitulation—vv.12-18

    - The is no grace in self-protection

2. Jesus’ courage vs. Peter’s cowardice—vv.19-27

    - Jesus was challenging to have witnesses come and testify about what he taught in order to unmask their motives

    - This scene in history demonstrates further how Jesus was submitting (remember in the garden only two words, "I am", and everyone fell)

    - Your either turn from your lies or compound them

    - This demonstrates the depravity of man which requires God to change us

#### III. The kingly surrender of Christ vs. the pseudo control of man— 18:28-19:15

_We can gain great confidence in God’s sovereign plan for our lives by looking at 4 outcomes of Christ surrendering to his condemnation:_

    - Website has clarification on the seemingly different timing of passover in the gospels

1. The unfounded delivering of the King confirmed his word— vv.28-32 (January 28, 2024)

    - Pilot had previously shown bad leadership

    - Roman rule prevented the Jews from carrying out Mosaic law death penalty

1. The uninformed questioning of the King revealed his purpose— vv.33-38

    - Being born again of the spirit is required to see Jesus as King in His first coming

3. The unjust treatment of the King contradicted his innocence- vv.38b-19:7 (February 4, 2024)

    - Barabbas means son of the father, adding to the irony of the crucifixion which was also paralleled in the prophecy in John 10

    - The beatings were possibly an attempt o Pilot to satisfy the mob, considering he found nothing wrong and was trying to transfer responsibility to the Jewish leaders

    - Pilot saying "the man" as another attempt to show that Jesus was no threat considering the display of a punished body as a harmless man

1. The unsubstantiated condemnation of the King vindicated his identity—vv.8-15

    - The charge of Jesus' calling himself the Son of God has been brewing since John 5:18

    - In our personal lives we must not have declaring/defending our innocence be the top priority or we may be against God's plan

    - Jesus tends to only answer those questioning Him if the one questioning is seeking the truth

    - Caiaphas is likely the one who has the greater sin

    - Fear of man makes one  vulnerable to be easily manipulated

    - v14 demonstrates how Jesus is the final sacrifice
