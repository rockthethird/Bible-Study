# John 18

## Sermon Notes

### How the Impotent Ways of Man are Confounded by the Sovereign Plan of God (December 17, 2023)

#### I. The purposes of Christ vs. the purposes of man vv.1-11

_Jesus’ responses expose 2 lies fueling those involved in his arrest:_

1. Lie #1—God’s plan can be conquered by human scheming - vv.1-9

2. Lie #2—God’s plan can be accomplished through human strength -  vv.10-11

    - Peter's prideful unbelief caused him to act (completely ignoring what Jesus just did with only 2 words) in a way that shows the need we have of God to provide the ability to know God's will

### Jesus Came to Bring the Truth v.37 (December 25, 2023)

_In order to take heed to the truth as we ought, there are 4 insights we must understand about Christ coming to testify to the truth:_

1. There is an absolute knowledge represented in this truth

    - All of what God is or does is truth because everything exists from God therefore nothing that is true can come from another source

1. Christ is the perfect representation of this truth

    - The Word became flesh

1. Eternal salvation can only be obtained through faith in this truth

    - We receive this truth as we are enabled to understand it and then we become witnesses of the truth

1. There will always be those who oppose this truth

    - Anyone who opposes the truth also opposes God

    - Their heart mut be changed by God if every they are to understand
