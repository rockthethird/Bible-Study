### How Christians Can Exalt The Love of Christ

#### I. Embrace your desperate need for cleansing vv.6-11 (April 23, 2023)

_2 reasons why embracing your need for cleansing is necessary:_

1. Because cleansing is necessary due to sinfulness - vv.6-8

    - Much move than the maximal humility of this act

    - We need the cleansing of Christ for salvific benefit

    - Performing acts of religion do not cleanse the heart; not even that which God has commanded

    - Peter likely knew he needed washing from the many sins performed (his hands) and sins he thinks (his head)

1. Because cleansing is necessary to bring forth salvation - vv.9-11

    - Jesus reminds that the symbol of cleansing is not what cleans, even that performed by Him

    - Only in the blood shed/finished work of Christ are we cleansed

    - Even close proximity to the Christ does not guarantee anything

#### IV. Mimic Christ for maximum gospel influence vv.31-35 (May 21, 2023)

_2 final ways to exalt the love of Christ:_

1. Based on His approved accomplishments - vv.31-32

    - Jesus becoming man and fully obeying demonstrates God's attributes glorifying Himself and the Father

    - Upholds his glory to Himself v.32

    - The death of ourselves also glorifies God (see Galatians)

1. Based on His abiding authority - vv.33-35

    - Arguably the key commandment of the entire New Testament

    - Only God can provide commandments

    - Love without seeking reciprocation or based on the worthiness of the recipient

    - Not an emotion and can be done without feelings all together

    - "New commandment" because we have better clarity with Christ's example of loving those who don't deserve it

#### V. Refuse to trust in your capabilities - vv.36-38

- Peter's human weakness was revealed in his denials, thus showing weakness is our true disposition without God's strength to love like Him
