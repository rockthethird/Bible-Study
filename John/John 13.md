### How Christians Can Exalt The Love of Christ

#### I. Embrace your desperate need for cleansing vv.6-11 (April 23, 2023)

_2 reasons why embracing your need for cleansing is necessary:_

1. Because cleansing is necessary due to sinfulness - vv.6-8

    - Much move than the maximal humility of this act

    - We need the cleansing of Christ for salvific benefit

    - Performing acts of religion do not cleanse the heart; not even that which God has commanded

    - Peter likely knew he needed washing from the many sins performed (his hands) and sins he thinks (his head)

1. Because cleansing is necessary to bring forth salvation - vv.9-11

    - Jesus reminds that the symbol of cleansing is not what cleans, even that performed by Him

    - Only in the blood shed/finished work of Christ are we cleansed

    - Even close proximity to the Christ does not guarantee anything
