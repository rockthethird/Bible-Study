### Antidotes to Worldliness

_3 gospel antidotes to worldliness_

1. Gospel sobriety

    - Keep careful watch on yourself and personal sin which is what allows the worldliness inside

1. Gospel humility

    - Don't be deceived about what you think you know

    - Prefer God's wisdom over our own

    - Worldly wisdom is only horizontal

    - But in God's presence worldly wisdom is consummed by His

1. Gospel identity

    - A high view of worldly wisdom ultimately results in worshiping the world and what it provides the flesh

    - We do not belong to ourselves, or this world, but God
