# Manhood According to God

## Sermon Notes

Pastor Matt Borgstrom

### I. Men must be trustworthy, servant leaders - Acts 6:3 (March 3, 2024)

- Assessment and not random selection

- You must be aware of your reputation; how you seek God's glory and not your own

- Be seeking the fruit of the spirit in your life

- Wisdom is practicing skillful living

- Serving is leadership and cannot exclusively be separated

### II. Obstacles to biblical manhood

1. Self-infatuation - Gal. 5:13

    - Ask yourself, are you freedom's serving other or yourself

1. Self-protection - 1 Sam. 15:18-24

    - Every husband leads, it's a matter of where, good or bad

    - Men should care of Christ's reputation and not his own

1. Self-promotion - Mark 9:33-37

    - Being first is in context of God's eyes

    - A child cannot give anything back to someone who only cares of what they get back from their efforts

- Concluding charge to congregation

    - Do not be content sitting around being served

### III. Husbands must be attentive admirers (March 10, 2024)

- Introduction

    - More than any other: his mother, father, children, etc.

    - Christ will protect you while you sacrificially love like Him

    - Is not dependent on feelings, never mentioned in the rich verses of Eph. 5

<center>Ephesians 5:25-30</center>

_The Apostle Paul supplies 2 comparisons so that husbands would attentively love their wives as they ought:_

1. The comparison to Christ's love for his bride (vv.25b-27)

    - We cannot sanctify someone else

    - Anger is a signal that a husband is trying to control even to the point of self-protection or self-comfort

1. The comparison of loving your own flesh (vv.28-30)

    - Apply the instinct to care, protect, nourish, cherish, ourselves towards our wives

<center>1 Peter 3:7</center>

_The Apostle Peter puts forth 2 principles a husband must practice to admire his wife in a Christ-exalting way:_

1. A husband must admire his wife by studying her

    - Takes time and effort

1. A husband must admire his wife by esteeming her

    - This is especially important for moms who are at home with children who are dishonoring her all day

    - Hindered prayers is a severe consequence in this life

    - Spiritual prosperity is brought down as well, no matter what is appearing on the outside
