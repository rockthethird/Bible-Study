# Manhood According to God

## Sermon Notes

Pastor Matt Borgstrom (March 3, 2024)

1. Men must be trustworthy, servant leaders—Acts 6:3

    - Assessment and not random selection

    - You must be aware of your reputation; how you seek God's glory and not your own

    - Be seeking the fruit of the spirit in your life

    - Wisdom is practicing skillful living

    - Serving is leadership and cannot exclusively be separated

2. Obstacles to biblical manhood

    1. Self-infatuation—Gal. 5:13

        - Ask yourself, are you freedom's serving other or yourself

    1. Self-protection—1 Sam. 15:18-24

        - Every husband leads, it's a matter of where, good or bad

        - Men should care of Christ's reputation and not his own

    1. Self-promotion—Mark 9:33-37

        - Being first is in context of God's eyes

        - A child cannot give anything back to someone who only cares of what they get back from their efforts

    - Concluding charge to congregation

        - Do not be content sitting around being served
