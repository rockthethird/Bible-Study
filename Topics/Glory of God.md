### How the Glory of God was Glorified in the Cross of Christ

_5 attributes of God's glory displayed on the cross that solidifies our trust in the finished work of Christ:_

1. His absolute sovereignty

    - We glorify God as well when we submit to His sovereignty in every detail of our lives

1. His holy wrath

    - Only the perfect son could take on God's wrath

    - Flesh has life in blood

1. His unwavering righteousness

    - Shows how we can declare Old Testament men are right before Him, think Abraham

1. His gracious love

    - Death showed love

    - True love is sacrificial

1. His supreme power

    - Removed the eternal power of sin and death
    
    - Satan had this power before Christ's work
