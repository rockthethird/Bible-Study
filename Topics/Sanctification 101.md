_8 essential ingredients needed for progressive sanctification_

1. A New Spirit (October 15, 2023)

    - Natural fleshliness must be removed

    - Memorize: Ezekiel 36:22-27 "<u>cause</u> you to walk in my statues"

    - This is a work of God alone

1. The Holy Spirit

    - Though we are/will be tempted the Spirit has freed us from the obligation to the flesh and are empower to strive in the Truth to overpower the flesh

    - The practice will be of deeds of righteousness rather than practicing deeds of flesh

    - Quote read during sermon: "We put to death the deads of the body by striving in the Truth and yield our will to Gods will by faith and in all our efforts the Spirit is supernaturally dispensing His power so that our flesh is literally overrun by divine influence and then we obey"
