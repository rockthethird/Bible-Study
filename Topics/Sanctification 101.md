### Sanctification 101

#### I. The Foundation For Sanctification

_3 truths about sanctification Christians must know in order to be increasingly sanctified:_

1. You will never be sanctified unless your old self has died through definitive sanctification

1. A New Heart (October 15, 2023)

    - Natural fleshliness must be removed

    - Memorize: Ezekiel 36:22-27 "<u>cause</u> you to walk in my statues"

1. The Holy Spirit

    - Though we are/will be tempted the Spirit has freed us from the obligation to the flesh and are empower to strive in the Truth to overpower the flesh

    - The practice will be of deeds of righteousness rather than practicing deeds of flesh

    - Quote read during sermon: "We put to death the deads of the body by striving in the Truth and yield our will to Gods will by faith and in all our efforts the Spirit is supernaturally dispensing His power so that our flesh is literally overrun by divine influence and then we obey"

1. Fear of God (October 22, 2023)

    - It is not worrying He will strike us down or bring consequences of our sin (immediate or eternal)

    - Verify: Fear does not equal terror, because it is an offense to a Holy God and our savior it's a slap in the face to what He did for us

1. Ingestion of Truth

    - Does not merely enlighten, it <u>transforms</u>

    - Using the Word we must constantly evict from our heart the sinful desires

1. Exercise of Faith

    - There is a way to have the Truth and yet not benefit us, it must be united with faith
