#### I. The Foundation For Sanctification

_3 truths about sanctification Christians must know in order to be increasingly sanctified:_

1. Fear of God (October 22, 2023)

    - It is not worrying He will strike us down or bring consequences of our sin (immediate or eternal)

    - Verify: Fear does not equal terror, because it is an offense to a Holy God and our savior it's a slap in the face to what He did for us

1. Ingestion of Truth

    - Does not merely enlighten, it <u>transforms</u>

    - Using the Word we must constantly evict from our heart the sinful desires
