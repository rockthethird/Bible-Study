# Training Pastors

## Sermon Notes

### “Why Every Church Needs to be Zealous for the Training of Pastors" (January 7, 2024)

_A healthy church that is zealous for the training of pastors leads to the duplication of healthy churches that maintain 3 biblical practices:_

#### I. Preach the Word—2 Tim. 4:1-4

1. Faithful preaching is derived from knowing that Christ will assess it - v.1

    - Anything built in human strength will be burned up 1 Cor. 3

1. Faithful preaching entails delivering only God’s message at all times - v.2

    - Opposed to "from", "with", "about", ...

1. Faithful preaching is necessary because many will repudiate the truth - vv.3-4

    - The reason for v.2 is found in vv.3-4

    - Sound doctrine does not align with the subjective desires of the flesh

    - "Myths" is extra biblical

#### II. Shepherd the flock—1 Pet. 5:1-4

1. God’s shepherds learn from biblical leaders—v.1

    - Suffering is the background of these verses, shepherds will suffer

1. God’s shepherds tend to the flock—vv.2-3

    - Time must be spent with the sheep in order to know when they are astray

    - In contrast, pushing sheep to psychologists removes shepherds from their responsibility

1. God’s shepherds look to future reward—v.4

    - Being faithful to God and looking forward only to the reward He mentions here apposed to early reward

#### III. Equip the saints—Eph. 4:11-16

- All christians are ministers/servants and require equipping for their ministries

- The body is equipped to withstand the deceptions of the world

- Enables the building up of the body
