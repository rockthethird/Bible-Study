### Womanhood According to God (March 17, 2024)

#### I. Women must be self-controlled, respectful learners - 1 Tim. 2:9-15

_2 exhortations given to women that, when obeyed, will uphold the unique function of the church:_

1. A woman must be properly adorned according to godliness - vv.9-10

    - Self-controlled respectable learners

    - God provided sexual coverings so we must honor Him with our choices in clothing

    - The specific prohibitions are not sinful themselves but must be considered if they will distract from the worship of God

    - V.9 (Likewise)-Paul is simply affirming that women are as responsible for the integrity of God's people at worship as men are. If men may imperil that integrity by misplaced zeal, women may do so by undue attention to how they look... Likewise, women...have ways of assuring by their intentional appearance that will contribute more to the sensual consciousness of people around them, or simply to the awareness of their beauty...than to a consciousness of holy God.

    _Robert W. Yarbrough, <u>The Letters to Timothy and Titus, Pillar NT Commentary</u>, Accordance electronic ed. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2018), 165, 166._

1. A woman must be reverently teachable according to design - vv.11-15

    - "Learn quietly" means learning free from contention

    - Not teaching the Word of God simply upholds the the Godly design

    - Eve was deceived due to the god given order was ignored by both Adam and Eve

    - Verse 15 is not about how to get right with God

    - Persevering is what you do when you are saved, staying on the path

    - Childbearing is a reference to to that which is exclusively a woman trait

    - We should be fearful of neglecting what God has ordered

    - V.11 (submissiveness)-The command is not for mindless submission, the surrender of independent thought or abandoning personal discernment. Nor does this imply a second-class rank for women within the church. Rather it assumes the fuller teaching of Scripture regarding the absolute authority of God and how He has chosen to delegate measured portions of that authority in certain institutions (e.g., government, church, home) and to certain people within those institutions (rulers, elders, husbands/fathers) for the illustrating of the respective roles of the Trinity in the purposes of redemption (1 Cor. 11:3) and for the outworking of His redemptive plan among humanity.

    - V.14 (deceived)-Paul was concerned that females in the church avoid the scenario that had precipitated the fall where Satan deceived the woman. The role reversal had been complete: rather than God being in authority over the man, who was placed in authority over the woman, who were in authority over the animal world (including the serpent), the pattern prevailing at the fall was the exact opposite: the serpent tempted and deceived the woman, who exerted leadership over the man, and both rebelled against God and transgressed his command.

#### Women must be submissive examples - Eph 5:22-24 and 1 Pet 3:1-6 (March 24, 2024)

1. Submission is based on acknowledging God’s design of headship - Eph. 5:22-24

    - A direct indicator of how much wives fear and trust the Lord Christ
    - Designed by God to protect
    - Christ submitted to ungodly authority (to remain in obedience to the Father's authority)

1. Submission is based on trusting God’s means of influence - 1 Pet.3:1-6

    - Quiet is not silent
    - Any Christian living must be driven by loving Christ, especially in the submission
    - Submission is a barometer of how much a wife trusts God
