### Womanhood According to God (March 17, 2024)

#### I. Women must be self-controlled, respectful learners - 1 Tim. 2:9-15

_2 exhortations given to women that, when obeyed, will uphold the unique function of the church:_

1. A woman must be properly adorned according to godliness - vv.9-10

    - Self-controlled respectable learners

    - God provided sexual coverings so we must honor Him with our choices in clothing

    - The specific prohibitions are not sinful themselves but must be considered if they will distract from the worship of God

1. A woman must be reverently teachable according to design - vv.11-15

    - "Learn quietly" means learning free from contention

    - Not teaching the Word of God simply upholds the the Godly design

    - Eve was deceived due to the god given order was ignored by both Adam and Eve

    - Verse 15 is not about how to get right with God

    - Persevering is what you do when you are saved, staying on the path

    - Childbearing is a reference to to that which is exclusively a woman trait

    - We should be fearful of neglecting what God has ordered
