    - The church belongs to God

    - Your are not your own v.14

    - The gathering of God's people (those called to fellowship with Christ), not where they gather, not those who attend regularity, or give, or ...

    - Verify: Irregardless of whether we are acting like God's church should act. Wow what a grace!
