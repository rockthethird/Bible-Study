# Marriage Charge

Taking time to reflect on profitable things to share has brought me through what's now almost 10 years of marriage this coming February. As you have grown I'm sure there have been hints of James 4:14 comparing our life to a vapor; but I have found there is no barometer like being married, and God willing having children. So that leads me to my first charge found from Psalm 90:12 and Eph. 5:16 where we are told to number our days and redeem the time. Hold on tightly to the simple moments were you two can just be together enjoying the others companionship and love. The bonds these moments create grow over time and is something God can use to see you through difficulty.

I have found in the context of eternity the difference in our preferences are so small and as leaders must know which to prioritize for our families keeping Romans 14:1 in mind. Work through these with her as your help mate recalling Proverbs 16:2. This can manifest in the need to choose your words carefully knowing they can have a huge impact on the weaker vessel, unknowingly steering your marriage off course at little at a time, James 3:4. Contrasty, you will find moments where the temptation to fear man shows itself in the name of love. Do not shy from sharing what must be said, but like Eph. 4:15 commands, share what must be said in love.

Lastly, I will say that Proverbs 16 has been profitable for me and will close quoting Proverbs 16:2 and 3 ESV, "All the ways of a man are clean in his own sight, but the Lord weighs the motives." "Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established." Strive to make all things you do in the marriage union a commitment to the Lord and may He bless it as you demonstrate your faithfulness to Him.

James 4:14
Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.

Psalm 90:12
So teach us to number our days,
That we may present to You a heart of wisdom.

Eph. 5:16
making the most of your time, because the days are evil.

Romans 14:1
Now accept the one who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions.

Proverbs 16:2-3
All the ways of a man are clean in his own sight,
But the Lord weighs the motives.
Commit your works to the Lord
And your plans will be established.

James 3:4
Look at the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot desires.

Eph. 4:15
but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ,
